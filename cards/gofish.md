1. The aim is to get pairs of cards in each of 3 (or 4) sets.

2. When you get a pair, show them to Dr Bean, and you get a point. Don't collect them. No points after the game is over.

3. Use English to talk to each other.

			Paul: Peter, do you have any
			*Supermarket* cards?
			Peter: Here, take them!
Or, if Peter doesn't have any *Supermarket* cards,

			Peter: No, I don't. Go fish!

			( Paul picks up a card from
			the pool.)

4. You have to give the cards to the person who asks for them if you have them.

5. The next person asks someone for cards.
